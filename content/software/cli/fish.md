# Fish

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and the rest of the family, that comes with a set of rich features out of the box.

> **ðŸš¨ Important:** Fish isn't Bash compatibly. So if you have bash scripts around, they will not work; but you can use a plugin to help with that your call into bash when needed.

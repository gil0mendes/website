Lately, I'm not being a regular blogger, but there is a crescent internal call to write something so I take some time to create my blog on my servers and with tools that I never have used in the past. I find this very interesting to learn new things.

Firstly I'll move some of the old articles from Medium into the blog and add some small updates here needed, then let see what will come to the tips of my fingers.

See you guys ðŸ‘‹

**Note:** you can see the old Medium blog [here](https://medium.com/@gil0mendes).
